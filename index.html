    <p><span class="greeting">Hello</span>. I'm <span class="highlight">Ian Christian Myers</span> and I make fun and interesting things for the web. Recently, I've been doing that over at <a href="http://www.zappos.com/zeta">Zappos</a>.</p>

          <h1>Zappos Map</h1>
          <p>Mappos, also known as <a href="http://www.zappos.com/map/">the Zappos Map</a>, plots orders, in real time, to their destination on a map of the United States. This was a fun side project of mine to explore custom overlays in the Google Maps API, which gained <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=Zappos%20Map">a little</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&q=Zappos+Map&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">attention</a> once the CEO posted on Twitter about it.</p>

          <h1>Faceted Search</h1>
          <p>The goal of our <a href="http://www.zappos.com/search2/null/">new faceted search</a> was to move from our existing single-select faceted search and move to a multi-select faceted search that was easier to interact with and made searching for items much faster. The challenge was to take it from concept to production in about a month and build it using the existing architecture.</p>

          <h1>Homepage A/B Tests</h1>
          <p>Hoping to get more out of our beta site's homepage, I created <a href="http://www.zappos.com/index4.zml">two alternative</a> <a href="http://www.zappos.com/index5.zml">homepages</a>. These homepages are more product-driven and dynamic than the old homepages, making them much more interesting and inviting.</p>

        <li class="column">
          <img src="images/zappalytics.png" alt="" />
          <h1>Zappalytics</h1>
          <p>At Zappos I've helped organize several Hack-a-Thons in which teams have 36 hours to work on anything Zappos related. Zappalytics is a real time analytics tool that I helped create during one of these Hack-a-Thons. It can display total revenue, amount of orders, 404 errors and 500 errors over the past two days, broken down by every 5 minutes, hour or day.</p>

          <img src="images/checkout.png" alt="" />
          <h1>Checkout</h1>
          <p class="last">When moving from our "classic" site to our redesigned "zeta" site, one of the more important components was <a href="http://www.zappos.com/checkout">the checkout process</a>. The redesigned checkout process aims to give users access to saved payment and shipping information, to make checkout a more streamlined process.</p>

      <h2>Other Projects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Vroom <span>(current)</span></h3>
          <p>I love writing JavaScript. <a href="http://github.com/iancmyers/vroom">Vroom</a> is a simple open-source web framework build on top of <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>. Node.js is an evented I/O wrapper for Google's V8 JavaScript engine. The net effect is a highly asychronous web framework written in and for server-side JavaScript.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Melissa Black, Photographer <span>(2008)</span></h3>
          <p>The primary goal of this site for photographer Melissa Black was to create an interesting photo viewer. The photo viewer was created with XHTML/CSS and JavaScript, making use of the jQuery library. The site also includes a simple administration system for uploading, resizing and organizing the photos.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Personal Blog <span>(2003 - 2008)</span></h3>
          <p>For five years I my blog functioned as a personal design playground, a place to refine my programming skills and a forum for me to discuss many things, but most often politics and code. It has shifted between pre-packaged content management systems and custom ones written in PHP and MySQL several times. Mid 2008, I stopped updating it, instead opting to focus on work at Zappos. I often toy with starting it back up again.</p>
