					<h1>Zappos Map</h1>
					<p>Mappos, also known as <a href="http://www.zappos.com/map/">the Zappos Map</a>, plots orders, in real time, to their destination on a map of the United States. This was a fun side project of mine to explore custom overlays in the Google Maps API, which gained <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=Zappos%20Map">a little</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&q=Zappos+Map&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">attention</a> once the CEO posted on Twitter about it.</p>

					<h1>Homepage A/B Tests</h1>
					<p>Hoping to get more out of our beta site's homepage, I created <a href="http://www.zappos.com/index4.zml">two alternative</a> <a href="http://www.zappos.com/index5.zml">homepages</a>. These homepages are more product-driven and dynamic than the old homepages, making them much more interesting and inviting.</p>

					<h1>Checkout</h1>
					<p class="last">When moving from our "classic" site to our redesigned "zeta" site, one of the more important components was <a href="http://www.zappos.com/checkout">the checkout process</a>. The redesigned checkout process aims to give users access to saved payment and shipping information, to make checkout a more streamlined process.</p>

					<h1>Faceted Search</h1>
					<p>The goal of our <a href="http://www.zappos.com/search2/null/">new faceted search</a> was to move from our existing single-select faceted search and move to a multi-select faceted search that was easier to interact with and made searching for items much faster. The challenge was to take it from concept to production in about a month and build it using the existing architecture.</p>

					<h1>Zappalytics</h1>
					<p>At Zappos I've helped organize several Hack-a-Thons in which teams have 36 hours to work on anything Zappos related. Zappalytics is a real time analytics tool that I helped create during one of these Hack-a-Thons. It can display total revenue, amount of orders, 404 errors and 500 errors over the past two days, broken down by every 5 minutes, hour or day.</p>
